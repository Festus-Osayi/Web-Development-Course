/**
 * Coding challenge 4
 * There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
 * other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
 * todo 1: Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
 * todo: Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. 
 * todo: The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, and 
 * todo: the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.
 * todo 2: Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
 * and print to the console: "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or
 * "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or "Both win the trophy" if their average scores 
 * are equal."
 * todo 3: Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
 * team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
 * score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as
 * well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
 * todo Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
 * both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 console.log()
 * points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
 * TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.
 * Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
 * Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

/** CHALLENGE #4
 * a very simple tip calculator 
 * Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant. 
 * In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. 
 * If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
 * todo 1: Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called tip 
 * for this. It's not allowed to use an if...else statement (if it's easier for you, 
 * you can start with an if...else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator).
 * todo 2: Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the 
 * final value (bill + tip). Example: The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total 
 * value 316.25.
 * Note: Use the values of the bill and tip variables to construct this string. 
 * Don't hard-code them ðŸ™‚
 * TEST DATA: Test with different bill values: 275, 40, and 430
