# Exercise - 6
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# BMI Wikipedia Page

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

# Example Input 1
# 1.75
# 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

# Example Output 1
# 26
# Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

# Example Input 2
# 1.58
# 57
# Example Output 1
# 22

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
# height = input()
# # 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
# weight = input()
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# # Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# calc_bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
# bmi = int(calc_bmi)
# print(bmi)

weeks_until_90 = 4_680
weeks_in_year = 52
weeks_lived = int(age) * weeks_in_year
weeks_left = weeks_until_90 - weeks_lived
print(f"You have {weeks_left} weeks left.")
